# Markdown Features

Docusaurus supports **[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)** and a few **additional features**.

## Front Matter

Markdown documents have metadata at the top called [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

```text
---
id: my-doc-id
title: My document title
description: My document description
slug: /my-custom-url
---

## Markdown heading

Markdown text with [links](./hello.md)
```

## Links

Regular Markdown links are supported, using url paths or relative file paths.

Let's see how to [Create a page](./create-a-page).

You can also use absolute paths like `/docs/tutorial-basics/create-a-page` (note: the actual path depends on your site structure).

## Images

Regular Markdown images are supported.

You can use absolute paths to reference images in the static directory (`static/img/docusaurus.png`):

![Docusaurus logo](/img/docusaurus.png)

You can also reference images relative to the current file. This is particularly useful to colocate images close to the Markdown files using them. For example: `![Alt text](./img/image.png)`

## Code Blocks

Markdown code blocks are supported with Syntax highlighting.

```jsx
function HelloDocusaurus() {
  return <h1>Hello, Docusaurus!</h1>;
}
```

## Admonitions

Docusaurus has a special syntax to create admonitions and callouts:

:::tip My tip

Use this awesome feature option

:::

:::danger Take care

This action is dangerous

:::

## MDX and React Components

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) can make your documentation more **interactive** and allows using any **React components inside Markdown**:
